    ~~~
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ~~~
    For Windows:
    ~~~
    > py -3 -m venv venv
    ~~~
2. Then, activate your virtual environment

    For macOS/Linux:
    ~~~
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    ~~~
    For Windows:
    ~~~
    > venv\Scripts\activate
    ~~~
3. Finally, run the following lines to install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy using pip:
